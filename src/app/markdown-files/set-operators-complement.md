# The Complement Operator in Set Theory

## Universal Set

The **universal set** is the set that contains all elements under consideration in a particular context. It is often denoted by $ U $, and every other set is considered a subset of $ U $.

### Example:
If we are considering the set of all natural numbers, the universal set $ U $ could be the set of all integers, i.e., 
$$ U = \mathbb{Z} $$

## The Complement Operator

The **complement** of a set $ A $ is the set of all elements in the universal set $ U $ that are not in $ A $. It is denoted by $ A^c $ or $ \overline{A} $.

Formally, the complement of $ A $ is defined as:
$$ A^c = \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin A \rbrace $$

Where:
- $ A $ is the set of interest.
- $ U $ is the universal set.
- $ \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin A \rbrace $ means "the set of all elements $ x $ in $ U $ such that $ x $ is not an element of $ A $."

## Examples of the Complement Operation

### Example 1: $ A^c \cup B $

The resulting set will have all elements not in A **or** in B, using $U$ as the universal set
the resulting set has $A^c \cup B$.
This means everything that is not in A or is in B is in the resulting set.

Formally:
$$ A^c \cup B = \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin A \rbrace \cup B $$

### Example 2: $ A^c \cup B^c $

The resulting set will have all elements not in A **or** not in B, using $U$ as the universal set
the resulting set has $A^c \cup B^c$.
This means everything that is not in A or not in B is in the resulting set.

Formally:
$$ A^c \cup B^c = \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin A \rbrace \cup \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin B \rbrace $$

### Example 3: $ A \cup B^c $

The resulting set will have all elements in A **or** not in B, using $U$ as the universal set
the resulting set has $A \cup B^c$.
This means everything that is in A or not in B is in the resulting set.

Formally:
$$ A \cup B^c = \lbrace x \in U \mid x \in A \rbrace \cup \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin B \rbrace $$

### Example 4: $ A^c \cap B $

The resulting set will have all elements **not** in A **and** in B, using $U$ as the universal set
the resulting set has $A^c \cap B$.
This means everything that is not in A and is in B is in the resulting set.

Formally:
$$ A^c \cap B = \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin A \rbrace \cap B $$

### Example 5: $ A^c \cap B^c $

The resulting set will have all elements **not** in A **and** **not** in B, using $U$ as the universal set
the resulting set has $U \ (A \cup B)$.
This means everything that is in A and in B are **not** in the resulting set.

Formally:
$$ A^c \cap B^c = \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin A \rbrace \cap \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin B \rbrace $$

### Example 6: $ A \cap B^c $

The resulting set will have all elements in A **or** not in B, using $U$ as the universal set
the resulting set has $U \ (A \ B)$.
This means everything that is in A and in B are **not** in the resulting set.

Formally:
$$ A \cap B^c = \lbrace x \in U \mid x \in A \rbrace \cap \lbrace x \in U \mid x \notin B \rbrace $$
