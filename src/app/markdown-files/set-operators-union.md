# Union Operator in Set Theory

In set theory, the **union operator** is denoted by $ \cup $. It represents the combination of two sets, including all the elements that are in either set.

## Definition

The union of two sets $ A $ and $ B $ is the set of elements that are in $ A $, in $ B $, or in both. Formally, it is written as:

$$
A \cup B = \lbrace x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \rbrace
$$

Where:
- $ A \cup B $ is the union of sets $ A $ and $ B $.
- $ x $ is an element.
- $ x \in A $ means $ x $ is in set $ A $.
- $ x \in B $ means $ x $ is in set $ B $.

## Properties of the Union

1. **Commutativity**: 
   $$
   A \cup B = B \cup A
   $$
   The order of the sets does not affect the union.

2. **Associativity**:
   $$
   (A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)
   $$
   The grouping of the sets does not affect the union.

3. **Idempotence**:
   $$
   A \cup A = A
   $$
   The union of a set with itself results in the set itself.

4. **Identity Element**: 
   The empty set $ \emptyset $ is the identity element for the union operation:
   $$
   A \cup \emptyset = A
   $$

## Example

If we have the following sets:
- $ A = \lbrace 1, 2, 3 \rbrace $
- $ B = \lbrace 3, 4, 5 \rbrace $

Then, their union is:
$$
A \cup B = \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \rbrace
$$
Notice that the element $ 3 $ appears only once in the union, even though it is in both sets.

## Conclusion

The union operator $ \cup $ allows us to combine sets, making it an essential operation in set theory and mathematics as a whole.
