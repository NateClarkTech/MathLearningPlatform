# Overview of Set Operators

In set theory, several fundamental operations help define relationships between sets. Below are key set operators with their notation and definitions.

## Union ($\cup$)
The **union** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cup B$, is the set containing all elements from both $A$ and $B$:

$$ A \cup B = \lbrace x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \rbrace $$

### Example
If $A = \lbrace1, 2, 3\rbrace$ and $B = \lbrace3, 4, 5\rbrace$, then:

$$ A \cup B = \lbrace1, 2, 3, 4, 5\rbrace $$

## Intersection ($\cap$)
The **intersection** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cap B$, is the set containing all elements common to both $A$ and $B$:

$$ A \cap B = \lbrace x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \rbrace $$

### Example
If $A = \lbrace1, 2, 3\rbrace$ and $B = \lbrace3, 4, 5\rbrace$, then:

$$ A \cap B = \lbrace3\rbrace $$

## Disjoint Sets
Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint** if they have no elements in common, meaning:

$$ A \cap B = \emptyset $$

### Example
If $A = \lbrace1, 2\rbrace$ and $B = \lbrace3, 4\rbrace$, then $A$ and $B$ are disjoint since:

$$ A \cap B = \emptyset $$

## Complement ($\complement$ or $A^c$)
The **complement** of a set $A$, denoted $A^c$ or $\complement A$, is the set of all elements not in $A$, relative to a universal set $U$:

$$ A^c = \lbrace x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A \rbrace $$

### Example
If $U = \lbrace1, 2, 3, 4, 5\rbrace$ and $A = \lbrace1, 2, 3\rbrace$, then:

$$ A^c = \lbrace4, 5\rbrace $$
