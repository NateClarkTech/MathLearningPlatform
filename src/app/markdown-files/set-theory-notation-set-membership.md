In set theory, **membership** refers to whether an element belongs to a set. This is denoted using the symbol $\in$.

## Basic Notation

- If an element $a$ belongs to a set $S$, we write:
  
  $$ a \in S $$

- If an element $b$ does not belong to a set $S$, we write:
  
  $$ b \notin S $$

## Special Cases

### Empty Set ($\emptyset$)
The empty set, denoted by $\emptyset$, contains no elements. Thus, for any element $x$:

$$ x \notin \emptyset $$

### Universal Set ($U$)
The universal set, denoted by $U$, contains all elements under consideration. Thus, for any element $y$ in the given context:

$$ y \in U $$

### Singleton Set
A **singleton set** contains exactly one element. If $S = \lbrace a \rbrace$, then:

$$ a \in S $$
$$ b \notin S, \quad \text{for any } b \neq a $$

### Power Set ($\mathcal{P}(S)$)
The power set of $S$ is the set of all subsets of $S$. If $S = \{a, b\}$:

$$ \mathcal{P}(S) = \lbrace \emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\} \rbrace $$

### Membership in Cartesian Products
For sets $A$ and $B$, the Cartesian product $A \times B$ consists of ordered pairs:

$$ (x, y) \in A \times B \quad \text{if and only if} \quad x \in A, \quad y \in B $$
