# Set Theory Theorems

Set theory is the foundation of modern mathematics, dealing with collections of objects called sets. Below are some fundamental theorems in set theory, formatted with KaTeX for mathematical notation.

## 1. De Morgan's Laws

De Morgan's laws describe how the complement of unions and intersections relate:

- $$ (A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c $$
- $$ (A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c $$

## 2. Idempotent Laws

A set operation applied twice yields the same result:

- $$ A \cup A = A $$
- $$ A \cap A = A $$

## 3. Absorption Laws

A set operation combined with another set operation simplifies as follows:

- $$ A \cup (A \cap B) = A $$
- $$ A \cap (A \cup B) = A $$

## 4. Distributive Laws

Set operations distribute over each other:

- $$ A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) $$
- $$ A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) $$

## 5. Complement Laws

A set and its complement behave as follows:

- $$ A \cup A^c = U $$
- $$ A \cap A^c = \emptyset $$

## 6. Double Complement Law

Taking the complement twice returns the original set:

- $$ (A^c)^c = A $$

## 7. Identity Laws

A set combined with the universal set or empty set behaves as follows:

- $$ A \cup \emptyset = A $$
- $$ A \cap U = A $$
